Collection Types in Python

This repository provides a brief overview of common collection types in Python: lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries.

## Lists

    Description: Lists are ordered and changeable collections. They allow duplicates.
    Syntax: my_list = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']

## Sets

    Description: Sets are unordered and immutable collections. They do not allow duplicates.
    Syntax: my_set = {'item1', 'item2', 'item3'}

## Tuples

    Description: Tuples are ordered and unchangeable collections. They allow duplicates and are generally faster than lists.
    Syntax: my_tuple = ('item1', 'item2', 'item3')

## Dictionaries

    Description: Dictionaries are key-value pairs, allowing efficient lookups. They are ordered and changeable, with no duplicates allowed in keys.
    Syntax: my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}
